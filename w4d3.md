W4D3: REST

Today is the day of acronyms. My favorite is still from the domain of biochemistry: SDS PAGE (i.e., " Dodium Dodecyl Dulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Elecrophoresis"). The two pertinent to Rails development are REST ("REpresentational State Transfer") and CRUD ("Create Read Update Delete").

REST, a concept first put forth by Roy Fielding in his UC Irvine doctoral thesis (_Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures_, PhD disseration, University of California, Irvine, 2000), is an architecture which "ignores the details of component implementation and protocol syntax in order to focus on the roles of components, the constraints upon their interaction with other components, and their interpretation of significant data elements" ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)).




W4D3: creating associated objects

I have been trying to find information on what is preferrable for the creation of associated objects. There seem to be two ways to go about it. The first is to create the object with a hash, including the foreign key to the containing object:

        # config/routes.rb
        resources :users
        resources :contacts


        # app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb
        params = { :contact => {
                     :name => "Mom",
                     :email => "mom@mom.com",
                     :user_id => 1 }
        }

        contact = Contact.new(params[:contact])

The other way would be to first find the containing object, and then build the contained object _through_ it:

        # config/routes.rb
        resources :users do
          resources :contacts, :only => [:create]
        end
        resources :contacts, :except => [:create]


        # app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb
        params = { :user_id => 1,
                   :contact => {
                      :name => "Mom",
                      :email => "mom@mom.com"
                   }
        }

        user = User.find(params[:user_id])
        user.contacts.build(params[:contact])

The former requires that there be a hidden form field with the foreign key in it, so that it gets packaged into the sub-hash. The latter uses the foreign key from the path, which Rails (or, rather, Rack) puts into the `params` hash at the top level.

Both get the job done: a contact is created for a particular user. Both seem to have their benefits and their problems.
