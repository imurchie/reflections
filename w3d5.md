W3D5: Singleton classes

Exploring metaprogramming in Ruby has been very interesting, and I've only begun to scratch the surface. And the central feature in that thin strip is the "singleton class" (not to be confused with the [Singleton Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern), which is implemented in Ruby with the [`Singleton` module](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/Singleton.html)), also known as the "Eigenclass," "Ghost Class," "Metaclass" or "Uniclass."

This class is an anonymous class into which methods defined upon an object (i.e., an instance of a class) are defined. Normal methods are defined on a class, which allows for those methods to be shared by every instance of the class (and subclasses):

        class Test
          def initialize(name = "Test")
            @name = name
          end

          def name
            @name.capitalize
          end
        end

When this class is instantiated those instances will each have a copy of their instance variables (in this case, `@name`), but will all share the instance methods, `#initialize` and `#name`, living in the `Test` class.

        one = Test.new("instance one")
        two = Test.new("instance two")

        puts one.name
        # => Instance one

        puts two.name
        # => Instance two

If we reopen the class (monkeypatch it) the method(s) we add will be available to all the instances:

        class Test
          def name_weird
            @name.chars.each_with_index.map { |c, i| i.even? ? c : c.swapcase }.join
          end
        end

        puts one.name_weird
        # => iNsTaNcE OnE

        puts two.name_weird
        # => iNsTaNcE TwO

But it is also possible to add a method to a particular instance of the class:

        def one.name_one
          @name.upcase
        end

        puts one.name_one
        # => INSTANCE ONE

        puts two.name_one
        # => NoMethodError: undefined method `name_one' for #<Test:... @name="instance two">
        # => ...

Where does this method live? In the Eigenclass! (Side note: I'm going to use "Eigenclass" here, since it obviates the confusion with the Singleton Pattern, despite its sounding somewhat poncy.) The usually anonymous Eigenclass can be gotten relatively easily:

        eigenclass = class << one
          self
        end

        puts eigenclass
        # => #<Class:#<Test:0x007f93735a7e50>>

        puts eigenclass.class
        # => Class

The methods can then be seen:

        # methods on the class
        puts Test.instance_methods(false)
        # => [:name]


        # first instance

        # methods starting with "name" on this instance (defined on it, or its parents)
        puts one.methods.grep(/name.*/)
        # => [:name_one, :name]

        # the methods on this particular instance but not parents
        puts one.methods(false)
        # => [:name_one]


        # other instance

        # methods starting with "name" on this instance (defined on it, or its parents)
        puts two.methods.grep(/name.*/)
        # => [:name_one, :name]

        # methods on the instance itself
        puts two.methods(false)
        # => []

All this is very interesting! And provides much insight into the object model for Ruby. More on this in the future. For the moment, we have an anonymous Eigenclass in which reside methods defined on an instance, providing _real_ privacy (unlike the "privacy" offered by the `private` and `protected` methods). We can get the method out of the instance, but we cannot bind it to another object:

        meth = one.method(:name_one)
        meth.unbind

        meth.bind(two)
        # => TypeError: singleton method called for a different object

So the Eigenclass of one object is an entirely different class, even when sharing a class hierarchy. This includes the Eigenclass of two:

        eigenclass_two = class << two; self; end

        meth.bind(eigenclass_two)
        # => TypeError: singleton method called for a different object

The final note about the Eigenclass is that, unlike a normal class, it cannot be instantiated:

        obj = eigenclass.new
        # => TypeError: can't create instance of singleton class
        # => ...

One further note to be made is the primary instance of Eigenclasses and singleton methods in Ruby, one that we use all the time without knowing it: the class method. All classes we define are instance of [`Class`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Class.html), into which we define methods for that particular instance. If we look at how the method was added to the instance of `Test`, `one`, we did it by using the instance as the receiver of the method definition:

        def one.name_one
          @name.upcase
        end

But this is just like the class method definition, which can be done three ways:

        # reopen the class
        class Test
          def Test.class_method
            "this is a class method using the class name"
          end

          def self.other_class_method
            "this is a class method using self"
          end

          class << self
            def further_class_method
              "this is a class method directly on the eigenclass"
            end
          end
        end

We could do all the tests above and it would come out similarly. The class `Class` is unaffected by these methods. Other classes can't access them. Absolutely.

Instance methods, on the other hand, I'm still attempting to figure out.
