W6D1: JavaScript

Finally! Semicolons!

JavaScript seems much more powerful and fully featured than I had imagined it to be. My only previous experience with it had been with alerts and whatnot on webpages.

It does, however, take some mental getting-used-to. The OOP model is entirely different, being based on prototypes. This I still need to digest before writing a post in order to make sense of it.

To make an object we can make a _function_ that acts as the constructor for it. Thus:

        > var Test = function(message) {
        >   this.message = message;
        > };
        >
        > var my_test = new Test("We're testing!");
        >
        > console.log(my_test.message);
        > // => We're testing!

But, other than the `this` in the body of the function `Test` there is no indication that it is meant to be invoked as a constructor method to create a new instance. If we call it in the wrong way, that is, as a normal method, things go wrong quickly:

        > var my_other_test = Test("We're still testing!");
        >
        > console.log(my_other_test.message);
        > // => TypeError: Cannot read property 'message' of undefined
        >
        > console.log(typeof my_other_test)
        > // => undefined

What? No object was created. What happened to the arguments passed in to the function? They are set **in the global context**!

        > console.log(message);
        > // => We're still testing!

The function assumed that `this` referred to the enclosing object, which in this case is the default global object. We don't happen to have a `message` property there, but if we did it would have been silently overwritten and we would have run into errors as we proceed. Alas.

This is indicative of the main thing I've taken away from JavaScript thus far: errors seem to be handled in obscuring ways.
