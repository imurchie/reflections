W4D1: What about `attr_accessible`?

We know what happens when we don't declare things through `attr_accessible`, but what does it actually do?

The class method is defined in the module [`ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity::ClassMethods`](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/MassAssignmentSecurity/ClassMethods). The code for the method itself is fairly simple:

        def attr_accessible(*args)
          options = args.extract_options!
          role = options[:as] || :default

          self._accessible_attributes = accessible_attributes_configs.dup

          Array.wrap(role).each do |name|
            self._accessible_attributes[name] = self.accessible_attributes(name) + args
          end

          self._active_authorizer = self._accessible_attributes
        end

The first part takes out the `role`, which is an optional argument specifying for whom these attributes will be assignable.

This method also uses the monkeypatched core method [`Array#wrap`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/e20dd73df42d63b206d221e2258cc6dc7b1e6068/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/array/wrap.rb), which wraps the argument in an array unless it already is an array:

        p Array.wrap(4)
        # => [4]

        p Array.wrap([4])
        # => [4]

The rest of the method builds a [`WhiteList`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/activemodel/lib/active_model/mass_assignment_security/permission_set.rb) object, which is a [`Set`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/set/rdoc/Set.html) with a few added methods for allowing and denying access.


W4D1: Rebuilding ActiveRecord functionality

Today's solo project was to rebuild parts of [`ActiveRecord`](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord). Largely what we rebuilt was the loading of data from the db, and some of the Rails associations (`belongs_to`, `has_many`, and `has_one_through`). It was very instructive, though not particularly hard.

When finished I did some of the extra work, but then went back to fix some things that were bugging me. The first was the way the instructions told us to handle the creation of accessor methods. Basically, we were to create the methods in the `my_attr_accessible` method. This means, however, that the only methods that can be accessed through getting and setter methods are those that can also be mass-assigned. This seems wrong, and certainly is not how Rails does things.

To fix the situation I created a class method for querying the schema of the table we're dealing with:

        class SQLObject < MassObject
          # ...

          private

            def self.schema
              unless @schema
                @schema = {}
                DBConnection.table_info(self.table_name) do |row|
                  @schema[row["name"]] = row["type"]
                end
              end

              @schema
            end

          # ...
        end

Then I overrode `method_missing` in order to catch method calls. If they are calls to getters or setters for valid table fields, I create the methods and pass the message along:

        class SQLObject < MassObject
          # ...

          def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
            possible_attr = name.to_s.sub( /=$/, "")
            if self.class.schema.keys.include?(possible_attr)
              if name =~ /=/
                # setter
                self.class.class_eval do
                  define_method(name) do |value|
                    instance_variable_set("@#{possible_attr}", value)
                  end
                end
                self.send(name, *args)  # need to call the newly minted method
              else
                # getter
                self.class.class_eval do
                  define_method(name) do
                    instance_variable_get("@#{possible_attr}")
                  end
                end
                self.send(name)  # need to call the newly minted method
              end
            else
              super
            end
          end

          def respond_to?(symbol)
            possible_attr = name.to_s.sub( /=$/, "")
            if self.class.schema.keys.include?(possible_attr)
              true
            else
              super
            end
          end

          # ...
        end

So the defining of methods is lazy, only done when they are called. Otherwise the methods are not created.

Now the two conceptually different things, accessiblity (through `attr_accessor`) and mass-assignability (through `attr_accessible`) are functionally separable. It is not possible to define a class:

        class Cat < SQLObject
          set_table_name("cats")
          my_attr_accessible(:name)

          belongs_to :human, :class_name => "Human", :primary_key => :id, :foreign_key => :owner_id
          has_one_through :house, :human, :house
        end

That can still have access to `id`:

        cat = Cat.find(1)

        puts cat.id
        # => 1

Yay!

Otherwise the implementation as described in the instructions made sense and were useful.
