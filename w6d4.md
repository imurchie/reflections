W6D4: JavaScript and Scope

Yesterday my partner wrote some JS code that included a `for` loop, and in doing so instantiated a variable in the loop, then used it outside the loop. This got me thinking about scope in JavaScript, as this behaviour does not seem logical:

        > for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        >   var local = i;
        > }
        >
        > console.log(local);
        > // => 9
        > console.log(i);
        > // => 10

Crazy! Not only is the local variable defined in the block available, so is the loop variable! In, for instance, [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), we would get compiler errors:

        /* scope.c */
        #include <stdio.h>

        int main() {
          int function_local = 3;

          for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
            int local = i;
          }

          printf("Function local: %d\n", function_local);
          printf("Loop counter: %d\n", i);
          printf("Local: %d\n", local);
        }

        > gcc scope.c -o scope
        $ gcc scope.c -o scope
            scope.c:11:32: error: use of undeclared identifier 'i'
              printf("Loop counter: %d\n", i);
                                           ^
            scope.c:12:25: error: use of undeclared identifier 'local'
              printf("Local: %d\n", local);

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) also behaves reasonably:

        [1] pry(main)> 3.times do |i|
        [1] pry(main)*   local = i
        [1] pry(main)* end
        => 3
        [2] pry(main)> local
        NameError: undefined local variable or method `local' for main:Object
          from: (pry):4:in `__pry__'
        [3] pry(main)> i
        NameError: undefined local variable or method `i' for main:Object
          from: (pry):5:in `__pry__'

JavaScript appears to only support one scope, which is the function. All variable declarations are "hoisted" to the beginning of the method in which they are defined, even if they are defined within enclosing blocks. This means that not only are the variables inside the `for` loop available outside, they are available _before_ they are defined, since the definition is moved up:

        var f = function(name) {
          var function_local = 3;

          console.log("For loop counter: " + i);

          for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            var local = i;
          }

          console.log("Local variable: " + local);
        }

        f("Isaac");
        // => For loop counter: undefined
        // => Local variable: 9

        console.log(i);
        // => ReferenceError: i is not defined
We can see that `i` is defined, though it has no value (`undefined`, as distinct from `not defined`). Outside the function `i` remains undefined.

This is something to watch out for! And to look into why it was done this way.
