W5D4: RSpec and Rails

So after quite a bit of working on Rails we are finally doing some tests, beyond simply clicking a few links, creating a few instances in the console. Automated testing, in our case with [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), seems like the perfect way to go about putting the model layer through the paces. Especially for rather formulaic stuff like much of what we are building, if a team were to have a set of specs for, say authentication, that could just be brought into a new project, the code could be tested and little problems (e.g., forgetting to set such-and-such a value) would be caught routinely.

In our case the major problem is figuring out what to cover. What sorts of things are testing _our_ code, and therefore are necessary, and what is simply making sure that Rails behaves as Rails behaves, which is not necessary to test for a mature framework.

We therefore do not need to test that when an attribute is set, it is persisted. We _do_, however, need to test that when it is not set, but it manditory in our business rules, we catch it. The former is Rails doing Rails stuff. The latter is our validation. Nothing is lost by testing both (other than our time in writing the first test) but nor is there anything gained.

Another source of problems is figuring out what tests are presupposed in other tests. So, with the [`shoulda`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda) gem we can test an association:

        # app/models/user.rb
        class User < ActiveRecord::Base
          # ...
        end

        # app/models/sub.rb
        class Sub < ActiveRecord::Base
          # ...

          belongs_to :moderator, class_name: "User"

          # ...
        end

        # spec/models/sub_spec.rb
        # ...
        it { should belong_to(:moderator, class_name: "User") }

The test here checks both that there is a `moderator` association, and therefore a `Sub#moderator` method, as well as that we get back a `User` object from it. If Rails acts as Rails acts, this is essentially the same as saying:

        # spec/models/sub_spec.rb
        # ...
        context "association with moderator" do
          it { should respond_to(:moderator) }
          it "should have User object" do
            FactoryGirl.create(:sub).should be_instance_of(User)
          end
        end

However, if we have not passed in the `class_name` option to the `shoulda` matcher we would not have tested the second part of the second spec above. Rather, we would know there is an association, but in our code we could have mapped it to something else (a hypothetical `Moderator` object, for instance).
