W3D2: Save

Today we worked on creating a database schema and then mapping it in Ruby objects. Relatively straightforward, other than some complexity around the many-to-many relationships.

One aspect that tripped us up for a while was `#save`. Particularly, not allowing the user to instantiate an object with an existing `id`, and then overwrite that row in the database with new information.

But Ruby does not enforce any kind of data hiding or access control very strongly. We can always use some of the introspective methods in order to get around it. So, if `id` is not accessible through a writer:

        class Test
          attr_reader :id
          attr_accessor :name

          def initialize(id, name)
            @id = id
            @name = name
          end
        end

        test = Test.new(4, "Test 4!")

        puts test.name
        # => Test 4!

        test.name = "New Test 4!"

        puts test.name
        # => New Test 4!

        puts test.id
        # => 4

        test.id = 5
        # => NoMethodError: undefined method `id=' for #<Test:0x007fbb440ce0e8 @id=4, @name="New Test 4!">
        # => ...

It can still be written to:

        test.instance_variable_set("@id", 5)

        puts test.id
        # => 5

So at the language level there is no enforcement. If we want to have any kind of a security model we need to program that in at the application level.
