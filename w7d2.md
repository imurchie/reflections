W7D2: Backbone

Today we worked on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) after a looooooong lecture from Ned.

The framework was, however, very interesting. After having build much the same thing yesterday in vanilla [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), even in a small application is was easy to see how the code could be much cleaner. I cannot imagine trying to build a large single-page application without some sort of framework, even one with loose conventions like Backbone.
