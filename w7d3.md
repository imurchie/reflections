W7D3: Backbone forms and listeners

One problem I ran into while implementing a simple form in [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) was handling the listeners to the underlying model/collection. So, on a page with a sidebar displaying all the elements of the collection, the sidebar display is listening for `add` and `change:title` events. This is great, as changes are immediately reflected in the view.

However, when editing a particular post, we end up setting the property values on the model in order to persist them, and these (perhaps invalid) changes trigger a `change` event which, in the case of `title` (which is being listened to), updates the sidebar list. If we submit a blank title the model, either client- or server-side, will throw an error upon validation, but the view will reflect the updated, but wrong, values.

My solution to this problem was to work with a clone of the model within the view, so that the code is not updating the _actual_ model properties until there is a successful save:

        # app/assets/javascripts/views/post_form_view.js
        JournalApp.Views.PostFormView = Backbone.View.extend({
          // ...

          initialize: function(options) {
            this.formModel = _.extend({}, this.model);
            this.formModel.attributes = _.extend({}, this.model.attributes);
          },

          // ...
        }

The view then displays and manipulates `this.formModel`. The call to `Backbone.Model#save` then needs to set the values in the _actual_ model upon completion:

        saveEditedPost: function() {
          var that = this;

          this.formModel.save({}, {
            success: function(post) {
              that.model.set(that.formModel.attributes);

              Backbone.history.navigate("posts/" + that.model.id, { trigger: true });
            },

            error: this.error.bind(this)
          });
        }

This solves the problem, and with minimal fuss. There may, however, be a better way.
