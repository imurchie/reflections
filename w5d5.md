W5D5: Personal Work

Yesterday I worked on getting [`RailsLite`](https://github.com/imurchie/rails_lite) and [`ActiveRecordLite`](https://github.com/imurchie/active_record_lite) working as Gems, so I could use them to implement something (authentication, naturally enough). Having gotten them in working order, I started working on the project but soon came to a couple of problems. One was that I had ActiveRecordLite build update/insert queries based on the instance variables of the model, which meant that I couldn't add any instance variables, or the queries would break. Luckily I had already implemented a method to get the schema of the table for the model, so I started using that.

Then it became obviously that I would really like some hooks for data manipulation: `after_initialize` was immediately needed (well, I could deal with it in `initialize` and require the developer to handle passing to the superclass, but that seems messy and un-Rubyish).

Initially I thought of making a series of methods that would be called at the correct places, and which could be overridden by subclasses (i.e., the models themselves). This would be a trivial implementation, but not very Rails-like.

Instead I decided to create a module in which would sit a class macro for setting a hook, and a class method for running them. The former is used at the discretion of the author of the model class. The latter is called by `SQLObject` in the appropriate place. In keeping with the principle of **You Aren't Gonna Need It**, I have only implemented the `after_initialize` hook. To set up the hooks, the method takes in a list of arguments, and perhaps a block:

          # lib/active_record_lite/hooks.rb
          def after_initialize(*args, &block)
            @_after_initialize_hooks ||= []

            args.each do |hook|
              if (hook.is_a?(Symbol) || hook.is_a?(String)) && self.method_defined?(hook)
                @_after_initialize_hooks.push(hook.to_sym)
              elsif hook.respond_to?(:call)
                @_after_initialize_hooks.push(hook)
              else
                raise "Invalid after_initialize hook: '#{hook}'"
              end
            end

            @_after_initialize_hooks.push(block) if block
          end

As can be seen, it stores either a `Symbol` which is the name of a method, or a proc, as well as a block. Thus it could be called:

          after_initialize :my_method
          after_initialize Proc.new { some_stuff }
          after_initialize { some_other_stuff }

In my case, to initialize the `session_token` for a user, my code looks like:

          # app/models/user.rb
          class User < ActiveRecordLite::SQLObject
            my_attr_accessible :name, :username, :password

            after_initialize { self.session_token = SecureRandom::urlsafe_base64(16) }

            # ...
          end

Back in the `ActiveRecordLite` code, I provide a method, called at the end of `SQLObject#initialize`, which runs the stored procs/methods:

          # lib/active_record_lite/hooks.rb
          def after_initialize_eval(instance)
            @_after_initialize_hooks ||= []

            @_after_initialize_hooks.each do |hook|
              if hook.is_a?(Symbol)
                instance.send(symbol)
              else
                instance.instance_eval &hook
              end
            end
          end

This simply goes through the stored hooks, and runs the corresponding code in the context of the current object. If more hook types (before some action, after another) were needed, the code could be refactored to handle it easily.

For my purposes, then, the `after_initialize` macro makes for the running of the block `{ self.session_token = SecureRandom::urlsafe_base64(16) }` for all new objects, so that the validation for the presence of a `session_token` in the database does not fail.

Next up will be validations at the model level (at the moment it happens in the db).
