W8D2: Polymorphic Associations

Yesterday I had decided to limit `Comment` associations to `Text`s, in order to simplify things. But I have now decided to add them also to `Review`s, so that I can take a shot at ["polymorphic associations"](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.14/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations).

This essentially boils down to providing an id, preceded by the gerundive form of the model. Thus, for my `Comment` model I have a `commentable_id`. This is paired with a specification of the type for the associated model, again in the form of the gerundive: `commentable_type`.

Thus for the `Comment` model, we have a table:

        # db/schema.rb
        create_table "comments", :force => true do |t|
          t.integer  "user_id",           :null => false
          t.integer  "commentable_id"
          t.string   "commentable_type"
          t.integer  "parent_comment_id"
          t.string   "title"
          t.text     "body"
          t.datetime "created_at",        :null => false
          t.datetime "updated_at",        :null => false
        end

And an associated model:

        # app/models/comment.rb
        class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
          # ...

          belongs_to :commentable, :polymorphic => true

          # ...
        end

The Rails system will follow the `belongs_to` association, check the type and then try to find a model of that type with the correct id. In my system there are two elements that are `commentable`, the `Text` and the `Review`. Both function essentially as they would, except instead of a normal `has_many` relationship with `Comment`, they have a polymorphic one:

        # app/models/text.rb
        class Text < ActiveRecord::Base
          # ...

          has_many :comments, :as => :commentable

          # ...
        end

        # app/models/review.rb
        class Review < ActiveRecord::Base
          # ...

          has_many :comments, :as => :commentable
        end

That is it! The schemas for both `Text` and `Review` are unchanged. The `Comment` model can now be associated to either one through its type first, and then the normal `foreign_key` relationship.
