W5D3: Fake Rails

Today we went all the way down to [WEBrick](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/webrick/rdoc/WEBrick.html) and implemented a rudimentary version of an application server, based on how Rails does things.

Having done, as preparation, [Noah Gibb](http://codefol.io/)'s [Rebuilding Rails](http://rebuilding-rails.com/) tutorial, which does much the same thing except starts with [Rack](http://rack.github.io/), I felt pretty good about this one. Many of the potential problems had already come up in building our version of ActiveRecord.

The most difficult part, conceptually, was getting the parameters from the request body into a hash to be used by the controllers. The implementation did not end up being particularly hard, after getting an idea of how to do it:

        # lib/rails_light/params.rb
        def self.parse_www_encoded_form(form_string = "")
          params = {}

          URI.decode_www_form(form_string).each do |key, value|
            populate_params(params, key, value)
          end

          params
        end

        private
          def self.parse_key(key)
            key.split(/\]\[|\[|\]/)
          end

          def self.populate_params(params, key, value)
            keys = parse_key(key)

            next_level = params
            (0...keys.length-1).each do |index|
              key = keys[index]

              unless next_level[key]
                next_level[key] = {}
              end

              next_level = next_level[key]
            end

            next_level[keys.last] = value
          end

The methods are class methods as I ended up needing them when routing, and did not want to create a full-blown `Params` object for that purpose, as it would not be able to be reused in the controllers. Essentially, the process is to decode the form data into an array of key-value pairs. Thus a form:

        # app/views/users/new.html.erb
        <form action="/users/create" method="post">
          <label for="user_username">Username</label>
          <input type="text"
                 id="user_username"
                 name="user[name]"
                 placeholder="Username">
          <br>

          <label for="user_password">Password</label>
          <input type="password"
                 id="user_password"
                 name="user[password]"
                 placeholder="Password">
          <br>

          <input type="submit" value="Sign Up">
        </form>

Will become, without processing:

        URI.decode_www_form(form_string
        # => [["user[name"], "isaac"], ["user[password]", "pw"]]

The code above then parses this and creates a nested hash:

        params = { "user" => { "name" => "isaac", "password" => "pw"} }

It does so by going through each level of nesting, from the outside in, and either accesses an existing hash or creates a new one. At the final level it assigns the value to the key, rather than another hash. This is done in the `Params::populate_params` class method.

Once that was implemented it was relatively simple. Once finished I went back in order to clean up the code. One part that displeased me that the handling of routes. The project specified the setting up of routes as happening by passing in a [`Regexp`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html). So a defined route would be something like:

        post Regexp.new("^/statuses$"), StatusesController, :create

This seems ugly, and laying too much on the developer's feet. Instead, I made it also take a string path:

        post "/statuses", StatusesController, :create

The string was then parsed into the correct `Regexp` by the `Route` class. This parsing included the necessary step to allow for ids within the path. So the user can do, in Rails-like fashion:

        put "/statuses/:id", StatusesController, :update

        put "/statuses/:status_id/links/:id", LinksController, :update

And so forth. This was done by splitting apart the path and replacing the identifiers with the correct regular expression code:

        def parse_pattern(pattern)
          return pattern if pattern.is_a?(Regexp)

          pattern = pattern.split(/\//).map do |part|
            if /^:/ =~ part
              "(?<#{part.sub(":", "")}>\\d+)"
            else
              part
            end
          end.join("/")

          Regexp.new("^#{pattern}$")
        end

The final issue with the routing is the handling of PUT and DELETE requests. As it stands only GET and POST requests will work. I added functionality to parse out a `_method` field from the form data in order to allow for the other two HTTP verbs. This was the point at which I needed the class methods from `Params`:

        def parse_request_method(request)
          method = request.request_method.downcase

          if method == "post"
            # POST requests can be POST, PUT, or DELETE
            _method = Params.parse_www_encoded_form(request.body)["_method"]
            method = _method unless _method.nil?
          end

          method.to_sym
        end

Essentially, forms will use POST with a hidden `_method` field that needs to be parsed out.
