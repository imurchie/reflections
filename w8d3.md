W8D3: My Favourite Game

In the course of playing with [Good Reads](http://www.goodreads.com) in order to mimic some of its functionality, I got to play my favourite game: the Amazon.com Knee-Jerk Contrarian Game!

Basically, look something you love, or which is generally regarded as great, on [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) (or, in this case, its subsidiary) and sort the reviews from worst to best. Then read the worst!

For instance, take one of the great books of this century, Orhan Pamuk's [_My Name Is Red_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2517.My_Name_is_Red?from_search=true) (about whom, and which, the Nobel committee noted ""who in the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures" [link](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2006/index.html)). On this treasure we get such reviews as

* "Kinda laborious read, more of a treatise on old Middle Eastern artistic traditions with an incidental murder-mystery and not-exactly-love story thrown in."
* "I was deeply troubled by the low quality of this book.... Unfortunately, the storyline is dull and lifeless - much like the characters that populate its 800 pages."
* "It is not often that I have been so bored reading a book."

Or perhaps you are more partial to the greatest living writer in the English language, Peter Carey? His Booker Prize winning novel, [_True History of the Kelly Gang_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110090.True_History_of_the_Kelly_Gang?from_search=true) elicited such gems as

* "I read this several years ago and this is one of the worst books I ever read."
* "This was an overrated piece of literary toilet paper."

Endless fun can be had.
