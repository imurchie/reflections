W5D1: Solo Day

It is lovely to have a solo day: to put in the earphones and sit back and write code without having to interact with anyone. It is also nice to have a fairly large (though still single-day) project to work on.

Nothing particularly problematic came up. Having gone through how to implement a _User_- and _Session_-based authentication system at least three full times, plus countless mental go-throughs, I feel pretty comfortable with it. The rest of the system did not particularly present challenges other than remembering what to do for each case. No difficult SQL or problematic model associations.

It still feels like, even for something small like this project, code begins to have circular dependencies very easily. And the separation of Models, Views, and Controllers takes a hit. I guess the way around this is to make judicious use of helpers, and to populate the correct variables when rendering views, in particular. The views are ripe for encountering the problem of having to send messages to things within other things, ad nauseum. For instance, giving a view access to an `album`, say, gives them access to the `band` that owns it, as well as the `track`s for it:

        # app/controllers/albums_controller.rb
        def show
          @album = Album.find(params[:id])
          render :show
        end

        # app/views/albums/show.html.erb
        Band: <%= @album.band.name %>
        Album: <%= @album.title %>
        # ...

These are relatively innocious, but the first line of the view, getting the `band` associated with the `album` and then sending it a message, is bordering on stinky. Perhaps it would be better to expose the `band` explicitly:

        # app/controllers/albums_controller.rb
        def show
          @album = Album.includes(:band).find(params[:id])
          @band = @album.band
          render :show
        end

        # app/views/albums/show.html.erb
        Band: <%= @band.name %>
        Album: <%= @album.title %>
        # ...

This, at least, signals the data we expect the view to use. It also gets rid of the dependency of the view knowing that an `Album` has an association with `Band`. Again, this is only a borderline case here, but we could easily imagine situations where it becomes much more complicated.
