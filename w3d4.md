W3D4: Curriculum oddities

So, sometimes our curriculum is oddly ordered. At times in retrospect it makes sense, as we get exposed to one way to do something and come to an understanding of how to do it, and then get introduced to a different way, whether a different methodology or technology or whatever, which solves those problems.

But sometimes things are done in an order I cannot fathom. For instance, yesterday we were asked to make a class method on a model, which did a query. This seemed odd, but then today we learn of "scopes" in Rails, and the copying of class methods from the model into `Relation`s build from it. Now it makes sense. But there is no payoff from not having known the reason yesterday.

But mostly the curriculum seems to be going along smoothly. It could cover more, but I might be in the minority on that.


W3D4: Complex Queries

I have finally come across [`ActiveRecord::Relation#to_sql`](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Relation/to_sql), a method that will return the sql for a query that has been built up.

So yesterday we had a complex query to get back a list of the most popular links for a given tag:

        # TagTopic::most_popular_links_in_category
        query = ShortenedUrl
          .select("shortened_urls.*, COUNT(*) AS visit_count")
          .joins(:tag_topics)
          .joins(:taggings)
          .joins(:visits)
          .group(:visited_url_id)
          .order("COUNT(*) DESC")
          .where("tag_topics.name = ?", name)
          .limit(10)

This is obviously a complex query, and cumbersome enough that it is difficult to visualize the actual SQL that is produced. In retrospect we should have used [`ActiveRecord::Querying#find_by_sql`](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Querying/find_by_sql). But given this form, in order to inspect the SQL we can do:

        query.to_sql
        # =>
        # => SELECT
        # =>   shortened_urls.*,
        # =>   COUNT(*) AS visit_count
        # => FROM
        # =>   "shortened_urls"
        # => INNER JOIN
        # =>   "taggings"
        # =>   ON
        # =>     "taggings"."tagged_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id"
        # => INNER JOIN
        # =>   "tag_topics"
        # =>   ON
        # =>     "tag_topics"."id" = "taggings"."tag_topic_id"
        # => INNER JOIN
        # =>   "taggings" "taggings_shortened_urls"
        # =>   ON
        # =>     "taggings_shortened_urls"."tagged_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id"
        # => INNER JOIN
        # =>   "visits"
        # =>   ON
        # =>   "visits"."visited_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id"
        # => WHERE (tag_topics.name = 'News')
        # => GROUP BY
        # =>   visited_url_id
        # => ORDER BY
        # =>   COUNT(*) DESC
        # => LIMIT 10

So there is some redundancy in the query created by Rails. If we were to hand build it, it would be much shorter, though the DB engine will get rid of any redundancy so it is not less efficient.

Further, the output is just a big string, without the pretty layout I've forced upon it.

There is one other method on `ActiveRecord::Relation` that is of interest in this regard: `#explain` (on this, see the [Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.14/) [article](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.14/active_record_querying.html#running-explain)). This issues a command on the DB to "explain" what it is doing. The output ought to be different for different database engines, therefore. For SQLite3 () I get:

        query.explain
        # =>
        # => EXPLAIN (0.1ms)  EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT shortened_urls.*, COUNT(*) AS visit_count FROM "shortened_urls" INNER JOIN "taggings" ON "taggings"."tagged_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id" INNER JOIN "tag_topics" ON "tag_topics"."id" = "taggings"."tag_topic_id" INNER JOIN "taggings" "taggings_shortened_urls" ON "taggings_shortened_urls"."tagged_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id" INNER JOIN "visits" ON "visits"."visited_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id" WHERE (tag_topics.name = 'News') GROUP BY visited_url_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10
        # => EXPLAIN for: SELECT  shortened_urls.*, COUNT(*) AS visit_count FROM "shortened_urls" INNER JOIN "taggings" ON "taggings"."tagged_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id" INNER JOIN "tag_topics" ON "tag_topics"."id" = "taggings"."tag_topic_id" INNER JOIN "taggings" "taggings_shortened_urls" ON "taggings_shortened_urls"."tagged_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id" INNER JOIN "visits" ON "visits"."visited_url_id" = "shortened_urls"."id" WHERE (tag_topics.name = 'News') GROUP BY visited_url_id # => ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10
        # => |0|3|SCAN TABLE taggings AS taggings_shortened_urls (~1000000 rows)
        # => 0|1|0|SEARCH TABLE shortened_urls USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?) (~1 rows)
        # => 0|2|4|SEARCH TABLE visits USING COVERING INDEX index_visits_on_visited_url_id_and_visitor_id (visited_url_id=?) (~10 rows)
        # => 0|3|2|SEARCH TABLE tag_topics USING COVERING INDEX index_tag_topics_on_name (name=?) (~1 rows)
        # => 0|4|1|SEARCH TABLE taggings USING COVERING INDEX index_taggings_on_tag_topic_id_and_tagged_url_id (tag_topic_id=? AND tagged_url_id=?) (~1 rows)
        # => 0|0|0|USE TEMP B-TREE FOR GROUP BY
        # => 0|0|0|USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY

We can see, then, what the database is doing with our query.

The last thing about this example is the extra field selected in the query. The basic query above is:

        "SELECT shortened_urls.*, COUNT(*) AS visit_count"

We're running this in the context of the `ShortenedUrl` class, so the first term returned will be used to create objects of that class. This is normal and no problem. The cool part is that the second part (which, now, must _necessarily_ be aliased (`visit_count` here)) will be made accessible through singleton getter and setter methods on the instances returned:

        links = TagTopic.most_popular_links_in_category("News")
        links.first.visit_count
        # => 3

The setter appears to be there for symmetry's sake. We can set the value, and that instance will continue to have that value, but it is not set (and, indeed, there is no logical way that it _could_ be set):

        links.first.visit_count = 42
        links.first.visit_count
        # => 42

        links = TagTopic.most_popular_links_in_category("News")
        links.first.visit_count
        # => 3

Fantastic! It works as we would think, even though it is doing some metaprogramming magic in the background in order to do so.



W3D4: Metaprogramming

Yesterday we were done a little early, so one of the TAs gave some interesting metaprogramming exercises to fill the time (exercises in http://ruby-metaprogramming.rubylearning.com/). Two in particular were challenging to my understanding of variables and scope in Ruby.

The [first](http://ruby-metaprogramming.rubylearning.com/html/Exercise_1.html) was to retrieve the values of all the variables defined in the class:

        class A
          def initialize
            @a = 11
            @@a = 22
            a = 33
          end

          @a = 1
          @@a = 2
          a = 3
        end

A few of these are easy, using [`Object#instance_variable_get`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Object.html#method-i-instance_variable_get) on the `class` first (to get the class instance variable, `@a`) and later on the instance of the class (to get the instance variable, `@a`). Then to get the class variable, we can either use [`Module#class_eval`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Module.html#method-i-class_eval) or [`Module#class_variable_get](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Module.html#method-i-class_variable_get). The only issue is there is only _one_ variable `@@a`, so you need to get the one within the class definition _before_ instantiating the class, at which time it is set to `22`.

The problem is getting the local variables. We finally came up with the solution by noticing that they are always the last expression of their respective code blocks. So they are the values returned by those blocks. Now, `#initialize` is called by [`Class::new`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Class.html#method-c-new), and so the return value we see is the new instance. Rather, we have to run `initialize` again on our own, using [`Object#send`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-send) to bypass the privacy, since `initialize` is private.

In the end, the code to solve this is:

        ret_val = class A
          def initialize
            @a = 11
            @@a = 22
            a = 33
          end

          @a = 1
          @@a = 2
          a = 3
        end


        puts A.instance_variable_get("@a") # => 1
        puts A.class_eval("@@a") # => 2
        puts ret_val

        obj = A.new

        puts obj.instance_variable_get("@a") # => 11
        puts A.class_variable_get("@@a") # => 22

        puts obj.send("initialize")

With this under our belts the rest were pretty simple, though a [similar problem](http://ruby-metaprogramming.rubylearning.com/html/Exercise_4.html), introspecting to get access to variables within an object, had subtly different issues. Here the problem was to use [`Kernel#eval`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-eval) and [`Kernel#binding`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-binding) to print out variables:

        class A
          @@a = 1
          @a = 2
          a = 3

          # Write your code here. Use binding method.

        end

        p eval('[@@a, @a, a]', *****)   # Replace '*****' to your code

First we need to get the `binding` object. We could use `send` to run the private method, but here we are allowed to create a method in the class to do so:

        class A
          @@a = 1
          @a = 2
          a = 3

          def get_binding
            binding
          end
        end

This, however, won't work as there is no `@a` for the instance of `A`. We need a class method!

        class A
          @@a = 1
          @a = 2
          a = 3

          def self.get_binding
            binding
          end
        end

Now we can run part of the problem:

        p eval('[@@a, @a, a]', A.get_binding)
        # => exercise4.rb:12:in `get_binding': undefined local variable or method `a' for A:Class (NameError)
        # => ...

        p eval('[@@a, @a]', A.get_binding)
        # => [1, 2]

Se we are in the same position as in the first problem. How to get access to a local variable, which by definition goes out of scope when the section of code (in this case a `class` definition) is finished. We cannot do as before, allowing for the default implicit return to happen, as we have a method afterward, so during `class` creation the last statement executed will actually be the definition of `A::get_binding`.

The solution I came up with was to have a parameter on `A::get_binding`, which will then be available in the context of the `eval` statement.

        class A
          @@a = 1
          @a = 2
          a = 3

          def self.get_binding(a = 3)
            binding
          end
        end

        p eval('[@@a, @a, a]', A.get_binding)
        # => [1, 2, 3]

This gets the correct output, and only involves adding the code specified, and so seems a valid solution to the problem!
