## W9D1: Bitwise operators

We haven't covered bitwise operations at all, but they are supported by the Ruby
language so it seems reasonable to explore a bit. Bitwise operations are particularly
useful in certain situations.

Ruby has all the standard bitwise operators, in both [`Fixnum`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Fixnum.html) and [`Bignum`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Bignum.html):

        & - bitwise AND
        | - bitwise OR
        ^ - bitwise exclusive OR
        ~ - bitwise NOT (one's complement)
        << - bit shift left
        >> - bit shift right

The first three are relatively straightforward. They act upon the bits that make up the binary representation of the number (or any other data... it is all the same to the program) in the ways that the names suggest. If the bit is set in both operands, it will be set in the result of `&`. If either is set, it will be set in the result of `|`. If one and only one is set, it will be set in the result of `^`.

So we can do things like:

        x = 1000 1001 # => 137
        y = 1001 1000 # => 152

        x & y
        # 1000 1000 # => 136

        x | y
        # 1001 1001 # => 153

        x ^ y
        # 0001 001 # => 17

The fourth operator, `~`, is slightly less straightforward, conceptually. It performs a one's complement, in which all bits are flipped. Since one of those bits if the sign of the number (logically, anyway: this is not entirely how Ruby does it internally), we end up with `-n - 1`:

        ~x
        # -1000 1010 # => -138

It is difficult in the abstract to see the use of this, but consider that when you check the arity of a [`Proc`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Proc.html) object, it will return the number of required arguments, or the one's complement of that number if the method allows for optional arguments. So:

        prc = lambda { |x, y| puts "x: #{x}; y: #{y}" }
        prc.arity
        # => 2

        prc2 = lambda { |x, y, z = 42| puts "x: #{x}; y: #{y}; z: #{z}" }
        prc.arity
        # ==> -3

We can then use our bitwise `~` in order to get the required number, while also conveying the information that there are optional arguments.

The final operators are for bitwise shifting. We can shift left or right by any number, effectively multiplying (when shifting left) or dividing (shifting right) by 2 each time. This is quick and, since the interpreter will switch to arbitrarily large integers if we get too big, safe.


### A problem for which we now have a solution

Let's consider where we might like to use these. Suppose we have to sort a large number of integers, like all the phone numbers for a particular area code. Since numbers (in the U.S., anyway) are seven digits long, there will be at most ten million of them.

This means that to read in the entire list and sort them in memory would require 40Mb (since Ruby uses 4-byte `Fixnum`s). What if we couldn't take such a large footprint? We could divide the numbers up and make multiple passes.

But with the bitwise operations we can do it much more efficiently, requiring only two scans of the data and much less memory. Indeed, we will only need one ten million bit number, which is 1.25 Mb!

The algorithm is essentially to take each number, and set that bit on a bit-array. Then to go through the array, and convert each set bit to a number, all of which will now be in order.

(Obviously, this will only work for lists of _unique_ integers. More work would be needed to track multiples, or to handle fractions, though neither is impossible with this technique.)

First we need to make the map:

        bitmap = 0b01 << max_number

Since we don't want the _value_ of the numbers we're going through, but the position corresponding to that value, we cannot just use the integer `10_000_000`. Thus the shifting of `1` over ten million positions. The resultant number is, in binary, 1 with ten million zeroes after it. This number will be `1250004` bytes long! I have started with a binary number, but a decimal would have worked just as well, functionally. I feel, however, that this telegraphs my intentions better.

The next step is to fill the data structure with bits corresponding to each number:

        # assuming `arr` is the array of numbers to sort
        arr.each do |n|
          num = 0b01 << n
          bitmap |= t
        end

Each number needs to be shifted to get a bit in the correct position, and then set in the bit map. We do this using the `|` operator, so that all the already-set bits come through, along with the new one.

The final step is to convert back to the numbers and print out, which we will do by iterating over the number space and printing any number for which there is a bit set in the map:

        max_number.times do |i|
          num = 0b1 << i
          if bitmap & num != 0
            puts num
          end
        end

This technique allows for an order of magnitude smaller footprint, and a more efficient sorting, since there is no need to pass over the numbers multiple times, as any traditional sorting algorithm would need to. Indeed, it is _O(n)_ where even the most efficient sorting is generally _O(nlogn)_.

The drawbacks are the restriction on unique elements, and the restriction to integers. We cannot, without some transformation of the data, sort arbitrary objects, for instance. Thus it is a specialized technique, but one that is very useful in its domain.
