W3D1: "Everything in Ruby is an Object"

We have, of course, already encountered blocks, which are not objects themselves, though they can be held by certain special objects (`Proc`s, whether normal or of the `lambda` variety).

But there are other non-objects in Ruby. David Black has a [blog post](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/09/27/almost-everything-is-an-object-and-everything-is-almost-an-object/) on the subject, in which he points out the central issue: in order to construct objects there needs to be something outside of all objects. It is not turtles-all-the-way-down!

So, to use his example, there is no object corresponding to the argument list (and, on the definitional side, the parameter list) of a method. If there were, then what would be used to pass in the arguments to the argument list object? To get around the tautology, there needs to be the functionality of the argument list external to the set of objects. It needs to be a feature of some other sort.

The further elements that are not objects include the language [keywords](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/keywords/1.9/), such as `begin`, `end`, `if`, `else`, etc. These, like the argument list, work to create the environment in which the objects function, and therefore must exist outside of those objects.

What brought this to the fore was a look at the "or" operator, `||`. Unlike some other operators, `||` cannot be overridden by a class. We cannot, for instance, do:

        class Test
          def ||
            # what would this even do?
          end
        end

The corrolary of this is that
