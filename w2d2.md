W2D2: Inheritance

Today we were introduced to _Inheritance_ within the Ruby world. Ruby only allows single inheritance, so no C++ style multiple inheritance with its [concomitant problems](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/225929/what-is-the-exact-problem-with-multiple-inheritance).

The primary utility of inheritance is to abstract shared code into parents, so that our code remains D.R.Y. as much as possible. So two classes that models versions of each other:

        class Car
          attr_reader :power

          def initialize(power = LOW)
            @power = power
          end

          def drive
            # ...
          end
        end

        class Truck
          attr_reader :power

          def initialize(power = HIGH)
            @power = power
          end

          def drive
            # ...
          end
        end

Can make use of the shared functionality:

        class Vehicle
          attr_reader :power

          def initialize(power)
            @power = power
          end

          def drive
            # ...
          end
        end

        class Car < Vehicle
          def initialize(power = LOW)
            super(power)
          end
        end

        class Truck < Vehicle
          def initialize(power = HIGH)
            super(power)
          end
        end

Now any changes to the driving functionality only needs to be managed in a single place, the `Vehicle#drive` method!

One thing of note is that all normal classes in Ruby eventually inherit from the [`Object`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html) class. In practical terms, having `Object` in the ancestor tree means that all of its methods are available to any normal object (I say "normal" since it is possible to inherit directly from [`BasicObject`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/BasicObject.html), which is a "Blank Slate" object with almost no methods). Like a good citizen, the `Object` class encapsulates object-like functionality, so we can then duplicate an object(using `Object#dup`), check if it is `nil` (`Object#nil?`) and other things logically related to object-hood.

Inheritance is the central canonical Object Oriented technique, allowing for reuse of code while maintaining encapsulation, proper abstraction, and polymorphism. There are, however, problems involved. I will explore these more in a later post.

In Gamma, _et al_'s _Design Patterns_, and Russ Olson's _Design Patterns in Ruby_ one major rule of thumb is "Prefer composition over inheritance." We should note, first, *prefer*! This is not "always use composition" or "never use inheritance." The statement is that many cases in which we initially turn to inheritance can better be implemented using composition.

An easy example, moving from the above `Vehicle` example, would be to think about what would happen if we were to introduce the concept of an engine. We could start with inheritance:

        class Engine
          attr_reader :output

          def initialize(power)
            @power = power
          end

          def start
            # ...
          end

          def turn_off
            # ...
          end
        end

        class Vehicle < Engine
          attr_reader :power

          def initialize(power)
            super(power)
            @power = power
          end

          def drive
            # ...
          end
        end

But if we think in English terms, this means that a Vehicle _is an_ Engine, which just seems wrong. Better would be to give the `Vehicle` class and `Engine` as an instance variable, so that, in English, a Vehicle _has an_ Engine:

        class Engine
          attr_reader :output

          def initialize(power)
            @power = power
          end

          def start
            # ...
          end

          def turn_off
            # ...
          end
        end

        class Vehicle
          attr_reader :power

          def initialize(power)
            @power = power

            @engine = Engine.new(power)
          end

          def drive
            # ...
          end
        end

This would seem to model the world better.

Further, in Ruby, we have the `Module` functionality, so we could refactor our original hierarchy of `Car` and `Truck` inheriting from `Vehicle`:

        class Engine
          attr_reader :output

          def initialize(power)
            @power = power
          end

          def start
            # ...
          end

          def turn_off
            # ...
          end
        end

        module Vehicle
          attr_reader :power

          def drive
            # ...
          end
        end

        class Car
          include Vehicle

          def initialize(power = LOW)
            @power = power
          end
        end

        class Truck
          include Vehicle

          def initialize(power = HIGH)
            @power = power
          end
        end

We can, then, still do all the `Vehicle` things:

        Car.new.drive
        Truck.new.drive

But we're outside of the possible rigidity of a class hierarchy, so perhaps a net gain.
