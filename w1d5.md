W1D5: Idioms and Habits

I am slowly to have in mind Ruby idioms for things that I would initially turn to manual techniques. The first that comes to mind is iterating over an array and a sub-array one shorter. How I would have done it:

        array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

        # how I would have done it
        i = 0
        array.each do |el|
          j = i + 1
          while j < array.length
            # process el (or array[i]) and array[j]

            j += 1
          end

          i += 1
        end

Which basically Ruby-ifies a C-style for-loop implementation

        for(int i=0; i<array.length; i++)
          for(int j=i+1; j<array.length; j++)
            # process array[i] and array[j]
          end
        end

However, Ruby can do this in a much better way, using `Array` and `Fixnum` methods:

        # using array indices so both sides are alike
        # and the C implementation is better mirrored
        array.times do |i|
          (i+1...array.length).times do |j|
            # process array[i] and array[j]
          end
        end

        # or with an Arrray method
        array.each_with_index do |el, i|
          (i+1...array.length).times do |j|
            # process el and array[j]
          end
        end

The benefit of the last two Ruby implementations is that the programmer no longer needs to keep track of the indices. We are, as developers, left with making the logic of the data processing rather than the machinery of iterating over it.

While I knew the methods, until recently they hadn't been in the fore of my mind when I arrive at a problem needing solving. I'm sure there are many more that will eventually percolate up so that they are the go-to implementations.



W1D5: Trees and Searching Them

The first data structure we're covering in class is the tree (binary and otherwise). It seems like we could have used a tree for implementing some of the earlier projects (particularly word chaining), so it could not have come too early.

Basically a tree is a branching data structure which consists of _node_s which have a one-to-one relationship with a _parent_ and a one-to-many relationship with _children_. While we are only dealing with unordered trees, there are ways to (and many algorithms for) maintaining balanced ordered trees.

Trees are useful for encapsulating data which is related in a branching fashion. If any datum is related to any other through a many-to-many relationship, a tree would not fit, but otherwise it may be useful. File systems, families (taking "parents" as a unit), paths through things, etc.

In contrast to one-dimensional data structures like the Array or Linked List (which, in Ruby, is functionality [encapsulated within the `Array`](http://www.sitepoint.com/rubys-missing-data-structure/)), which are traversed in linear fashion, searching through a tree can be done in many ways, primarily either _breadth-first_ or _depth_first_. Breadth-first searching looks through all the nodes at a particular level for a given node, so it will find the _first_ node, the shortest path to a matching node. Depth-first searching looks all the way down a particular branch, and then moves to the next branch, etc. This, on a sorted tree, would take fewer steps to find a node than breadth-first. What to use depends on the problem at hand. For a discussion of the various techniques, see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) on ["Tree Traversal"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal)
