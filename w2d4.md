W2D4: Interfaces

No, not a [Java](http://www.java.com/en/) [`interface`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html), but concpetually very similar. Java's `interface` is basically the specification of the public face of a class. Ruby doesn't have such a functionality explicitly built into it, though the design principle of writing to an "interface" still holds.

A Ruby class should provide a set of `public` methods which are the behaviours that it can be held accountable for. Other methods that are used by the objects of the class, or its descendents, can be made
`private` or `protected` in order to make them less accessible, and to signal that they are not supported, that there is no reasonable expectation of their being maintained throughout the development process.

Ruby's privacy markers are actually methods in the [`Module`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Module.html) class (which is the superclass of [`Class`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Class.html), and so within the class hierarchy of every class we, as programmers, define in our code). Without any arguments they set the privacy level until the next time one is called. With arguments they set the privacy level for the arguments, which are [`Symbol`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Symbol.html) objects referring to methods names. These can be any method named, no matter what their privacy status. So in a subclass we can change it:

        class Test
          def hi
            puts "hi"
          end

          private
            def hello
              puts "hello"
            end
        end

        test = Test.new
        test.hi
        # => hi

        test.hello
        # => NoMethodError: private method `hello' called for #<Test:0x007fc2411c6578>
        # =>     ...

        class SubTest < Test
          public(:hello)
        end

        test = SubTest.new
        test.hi
        # => hi

        test.hello
        # => hello

The subclass here, `SubTest`, does nothing other than set the privacy of `Test#hello` to `public`. Then instances of `SubTest` have this method in their public interface.

Another aspect of privacy in the Ruby object model is illustrated here. Unlike in Java, where [`private`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html) means that instances of the class have access and nothing else, in Ruby subclasses can access `private` methods without any problems. Indeed, "private" in Ruby means that the interpretter will not allow the method to be called with an explicit receiver. So within a subclass, where superclass methods are accessed directly, private methods are available! (But beware: you still cannot use `self`, even if it amounts to the same thing!)

        class Test
          def hi
            hello
          end

          def howdy
            self.hello
          end

          private
            def hello
              puts "hello"
            end
        end

        test = Test.new
        test = Test.hi
        # => hello

        test.howdy
        # => NoMethodError: private method `hello' called for #<Test:0x007fc244cb5530>
        # =>     ...

The call in `Test#howdy` is conceptually the same as that in `Test#hi`, but Ruby does not allow even `self` as receiver, if stated explicitly!

One more aspect to note is the third privacy level in Ruby, `protected`. This level is like "private," in that it is used to specify methods that are part of the _implementation_, not the _interface_, but different in that these methods can be accessed through an explicit receiver, by members of the same class or any subclasses

        class Test
          def initialize(name)
            @name = name
          end

          def hi(test)
            puts "hi, test instance"
            test.hello
          end

          protected
            def hello
              puts "hello, i'm '#{@name}'"
            end
        end

        test1 = Test.new("1")
        test2 = Test.new("2")

        test1.hi(test2)
        # => hi, test instance
        # => hello, i'm '2'

This is less used that public and private methods, but useful when some bit of data might be changed by other instances.

Finally, these are _guidelines_, promises as it were. It is easy, however, to circumvent the privacy by using some of the metaprogramming facilities in Ruby. See, for instance, http://gnuu.org/2011/01/01/rubys-private-keyword-is-not-heresy/, for a discussion of the problem theoretically. See


W2D4: Little Container Methods

Today's goal was to keep in mind the little boolean methods on [`Enumerable`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html), which I generally forget in the moment. These methods are: `all?`, `any?`, `none?`, and `one?`. Basically they all iterate over a collection, checking a block for a condition.

So, where I generally turn to writing the loop myself:

        numbers = [3, 5, 1, 7, 9, 4, 6]

        low_numbers = true  # whether everything in numbers is below 5
        numbers.each do |num|
          if num >= 5
            low_numbers = false
            break
          end
        end

        # => low_numbers == false

This functionality, however, can be dealt with more easily, and expressively, using some of the build-in methods:

        number = [3, 5, 1, 7, 9, 4, 6]

        low_numbers = numbers.all? |num|
          num < 5
        end

        # alternatively, and on average more efficiently
        low_numbers = numbers.any? |num|
          num >= 5
        end

The goal was just a matter of remembering that these methods exist when the problems they solve come up. There were a couple of times I noticed I was moving in the wrong direction, and corrected. And one time when I struggled to figure out the syntax for using the helpers. Overall, instructive.
