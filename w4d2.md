W4D2: Assessment 3

Today was the third assessment, covering some relatively basic SQL. Fortuitously, when class began I was finishing going over the page on movies, casting, and actors (so, doing nested `inner join`s, but nothing particularly difficult with the resulting dataset), and this was the material on the assessment. Almost word for word. There was one extra question, but it was along the same vein, and so perfectly doable.

I'm still not entirely clear if there is a rule-based workflow for creating queries. My approach is generally to decide what data is needed as output (for instance, if we're populating a particular object). From there, I figure out where it comes from, which will be either the `from` clause (if it is just a mass of data) or one or more `join`s (if the data is related)
