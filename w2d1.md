W2D1: Assessment

Today was the first assessment, on material from the first four days of class. So no trees or their manipulation. The first thing of note was the similarity of some of the problems to those of the preparatory material. Having done the prep-work for the assessment, they were pretty easy. I can see the value of figuring out how to solve a problem, and then remembering the solution and using it again. Of course, in keeping with D.R.Y., if this were outside of a testing environment we would put that into a library and then access the library version instead of rewriting it each time. But understanding how the library version works would be important still.

The second note was getting comfortable with TDD in this context. We haven't starting using TDD and RSpec in our day-to-day development, and my meagre understanding of the practice makes it difficult to see how some of what we build could have much test coverage, but the assessment is all driven by _specs_ that need to be passed. It is an interesting process.

W2D1: Git

As of today we will be using _git_ to deal with our code. Fun!
