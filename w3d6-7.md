Ruby method lookup

When a message is sent to an object it needs to be interpretted. If sent without an explicit receiver, Ruby first looks for a variable in scope with that name. Then it moves to the current object (what is currently pointed to by `self`) and looks for a method:

        class Test
          def test
            name = 1

            name
          end

          def test
            name
          end

          def name
            2
          end
        end

        test_obj = Test.new

Calling `Test#test` will return 1, since there is a variable in the local scope with the name `name`.

        puts test_obj.test
        # => 1

But calling `Test#test2` will return 2, as there is nothing in scope with that name, so the method `Test#name` is looked for, and found:

        puts test_obj.test2
        # => 2

But how is the lookup done? Where does Ruby try to find the method, and what happens when it cannot find one? The basic answer is that it looks in the class of the object receiving the message (`Test`, in the case of `test_obj`, above). If it is not found there it goes up the ancestor chain. In the case of `Test`, this means the default superclass, [`Object`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html), and its superclass, [`BasicObject`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/BasicObject.html).

If the method is not found in the class or any of its ancestors, Ruby begins to look for `#method_missing`. This lookup follows the same procedure as the original method lookup, except that the method is defined on [`BasicObject`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/BasicObject.html#method-i-method_missing) so it will always eventually, at the very end of the ancestor chain. This final method just raises a [`NoMethodError`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/NoMethodError.html) (source from [vm_eval.c](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/ruby_1_9_3/vm_eval.c)):

        static VALUE
        rb_method_missing(int argc, const VALUE *argv, VALUE obj) {
          rb_thread_t *th = GET_THREAD();
          raise_method_missing(th, argc, argv, obj, th->method_missing_reason);
          return Qnil;                /* not reached */
        }

Now that we have the basics, what happens when things are more complex? What about module mixins? What about singleton methods?

        class A
          def test
            "Instance method of class A"
          end
        end


        a = A.new
        puts a.test
        # => "Instance method of class A"

This is as we expect given the understanding above. Now let's add some modules to the mix:

        module M
          def test
            "Mixin method of module M\n#{super}"
          end
        end

        module N
          def test
            "Mixin method of module N\n#{super}"
          end
        end

        class B < A
          include M
          include N

          def test
            "Instance method of class B\n#{super}"
          end
        end


        b = B.new
        puts b.test
        # => Instance method of class B
        # => Mixin method of module N
        # => Mixin method of module M
        # => Instance method of class A

This shows us that modules mixed into a class are lower on the chain than instance methods, and that they are added to the chain in the order in which they are included in the class.

The next thing to try is to mix modules directly into the object, through the [`Object#extend`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-extend) method:

        module O
          def test
            "Mixin method of module O\n#{super}"
          end
        end

        module P
          def test
            "Mixin method of module P\n#{super}"
          end
        end

        b.extend(O)
        b.extend(P)


        puts b.test
        # => Mixin method of module P
        # => Mixin method of module O
        # => Instance method of class B
        # => Mixin method of module N
        # => Mixin method of module M
        # => Instance method of class A

Modules mixed into objects, then, act like those on the class, but supercede the instance methods.

What, then, about _methods_ defined on the object itself?

        class << b
          def test
            "Singleton method of object b\n#{super}"
          end
        end


        puts b.test
        # => Singleton method of object b
        # => Mixin method of module P
        # => Mixin method of module O
        # => Instance method of class B
        # => Mixin method of module N
        # => Mixin method of module M
        # => Instance method of class A

As we would expect, the singleton method sits at the head of the chain. But is this absolute, or just a consequence of defining it _after_ having mixed in the modules?

        module Q
          def test
            "Mixin method of module Q\n#{super}"
          end
        end

        module R
          def test
            "Mixin method of module R\n#{super}"
          end
        end

        b.extend(Q)
        b.extend(R)


        puts b.test
        # => Singleton method of object b
        # => Mixin method of module R
        # => Mixin method of module Q
        # => Mixin method of module P
        # => Mixin method of module O
        # => Instance method of class B
        # => Mixin method of module N
        # => Mixin method of module M
        # => Instance method of class A

Exciting! The singleton method stays at the top of the chain, the first place that is searched when attempting to find a method. As an aside, and just to drive home the... um... singularity... of singleton methods, if we define a singleton method on object `a` that method will _not_ be called when using `b`:

        a.instance_eval do
          def test
            "Singleton method of object a\n#{super}"
          end
        end


        puts a.test
        # => Singleton method on a
        # => Instance method of class A


        puts b.test
        # => Singleton method of object b
        # => Mixin method of module R
        # => Mixin method of module Q
        # => Mixin method of module P
        # => Mixin method of module O
        # => Instance method of class B
        # => Mixin method of module N
        # => Mixin method of module M
        # => Instance method of class A

Hooray! Things work as expected. And the process can be summed up:

1. Singleton methods on the Eigenclass.
2. Methods from modules on the Eigenclass, in reverse order of inclusion.
3. Instance methods of the class.
4. Methods from modules on the class, in reverse order of inclusion.
5. Return to step 3 for the superclass of the current class.
