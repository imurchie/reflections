W5D2: Assessment 4

Today we did assessment number four, our first [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) assessment. It focused on authentication, through creating a `User` and `Session` MVC stack. Pretty much exactly what we have been doing for days. All-in-all pretty simple, though there was always the possibility of forgetting some aspect of it. However, since it was run through [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) specs we could see the effect of forgetting something, triggering our memories.

The weirdest thing about the assessment was not requiring us to has passwords. We were, for some reason, instructed to use plaintext passwords in the database. Why? Using BCrypt adds, at most, thirty seconds of work, and is work we would _need_ to do in any real situation. It makes no sense to me.


W5D2: A Poem

**Of Linnets and Dull Times** ([John Ashbery](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/john-ashbery))

> You said you don’t want to know any more
> than you do now, of every thing that might be
> a person. It would be cheating. That is urgent.
> If we are going to mean in so many ways
> let them all be lopped off.
> That way we’ll know you’re getting older.
> I feel sorry for anyone that has to die.
> The lines of what’s expected
> fan out like beaters. That’s all,
> I think. But I lose things, now.
> The beautiful shape of the toilet interposed
> a viability as the air-raid drill ended.
> We’ve got to do something.
> He may be up there now, trying to find us.
> If you let me, I’ll drive you back to the fairgrounds.
