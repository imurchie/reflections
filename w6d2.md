W6D2: My new function invocation style is unstoppable

JavaScript has one type of callable object, the [`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function). Functions can, however, be invoked in different ways, which essentially means different contexts.

The first is **function-style**, in which the function is invoked as-is, in the context of the global scope:

        > var my_function = function() {
        >   console.log(this);
        > }
        >
        > my_function();
        > // => { ArrayBuffer: [Function: ArrayBuffer],
        > // => ...

The main upshot of this is that the function is called with the pseudo-variable `this` set to the global context (in the case of [Node](http://nodejs.org/), `root`).

When a function is called **method-style** it is invoked upon an instance of an object, and `this` within the function is set to the instance itself. The function thus operates within the context of the instance, much like a method would in other OOP languages:

        > var Book = function(name, author) {
        >   this.name = name;
        >   this.author = author;
        > }
        > Book.prototype.reference = function() {
        >   console.log(this);
        > }
        >
        > var ls = new Book("The Last Samurai", "Helen Dewitt");
        >
        > ls.reference();
        > // => { name: 'The Last Samurai', author: 'Helen Dewitt' }

The function has access to all the object's variables, and generally behaves as an instance method would in other languages.

The final "regular" style of function invocation is **constructor-style**. This is a chicken-and-egg case, since it is essentially method-style invocation, but at the beginning there is no instance of the object  to which `this` can be set. Thus the first step, before the function is invoked at all, is to create the actual object and set its `prototype` (either to that of [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) or that of the explicitly defined parent object). The last step, after the function has returned, is to ignore the return value, and return the new object from the first step. Between these the constructor method is run like any other:

        > var Book = function(name, author) {
        >   console.log(this);
        >   this.name = name;
        >   this.author = author;
        >   console.log(this);
        > }
        >
        > var ls = new Book("The Last Samurai", "Helen Dewitt");
        > // => {}
        > // => { name: 'The Last Samurai', author: 'Helen Dewitt' }

We can see, at the beginning of the function `this` has nothing defined in it (this, of course, is not completely true: just nothing user-defined, and thus displayed by _Node_). Afterward the user-defined instance variables are set. Thus at the end the instance that was created beforehand is set up as the developer wanted.

The last ways to invoke a JavaScript function are all explicit manipulations of the `this` pseudo-variable in order to call the function with a particular context. The three means are:

1. [`Function#call`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)
2. [`Function#apply`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply)
3. [`Function#bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)

Taking these in order, `call` applies a particular method in the context of a particular object instance, passing the arguments in as a list. In contrast, `apply` does the same but takes an array of arguments and passes them in as a list (functioning as a splat operator). Thus:

        > var test_function = function(arg1, arg2, arg3) {
        >   console.log(this);
        >   console.log(arg1 + ", " + arg2 + ", " + arg3);
        > }
        >
        > var obj = { name: "Isaac" };
        >
        > test_function.call(obj, 42, 4, 2);
        > // => { name: 'Isaac' }
        > // => 42, 4, 2
        >
        > test_function.apply(obj, [42, 4, 2]);
        > // => { name: 'Isaac' }
        > // => 42, 4, 2

As an aside, and in keeping with JavaScript's _laissez faire_ approach to error handling, function invocation ignores arity, and both `call` and `apply` will happily send more or fewer arguments than the function wants, and the function will blithely accept them, ignoring extras:

        > test_function.call(obj);
        > // => { name: 'Isaac' }
        > // => undefined, undefined, undefined
        >
        > test_function.call(obj, 42, 4, 2, 6, 2, 9, 7, 4, 1, 6);
        > // => { name: 'Isaac' }
        > // => 42, 4, 2

One interested use for `apply` is to add the elements from an array to the end of another array. [`Array#push`] can take any number of arguments, and add them, but if given an array it will just add it as the last element:

        > var arr = [2, 3, 4];
        > arr.push([5, 6, 7]);
        >
        > console.log(arr);
        > // => [ 2, 3, 4, [ 5, 6, 7] ]

So we need to "splat" the passed-in array:

        > var arr = [2, 3, 4];
        > arr.push.apply(arr, [5, 6, 7]);
        >
        > console.log(arr)
        > // => [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]

Cool!

The last style of invocation is actually more of a preparation for an invocation. Rather than actually running the code, `bind` sets up the context for the running of the code, by making another function object that wraps the context. This makes the function portable.

        > var Book = function(name, author) {
        >   this.name = name;
        >   this.author = author;
        > }
        > Book.prototype.reference = function() {
        >   console.log(this);
        > }
        >
        > var ls = new Book("The Last Samurai", "Helen Dewitt");
        >
        > var f = ls.ref;
        > f();
        > // => { ArrayBuffer: [Function: ArrayBuffer],
        > // => ...
        >
        > var g = f.bind(ls);
        > g();
        > // => { name: 'The Last Samurai', author: 'Helen Dewitt' }

We can, with `g`, pass the method around and call it, and it will always run within the context of `ls`.

This would be akin to the default behaviour of a Ruby method, which can be retrieved as an object, but remains bound to its instance, unless explicitly unbound).
