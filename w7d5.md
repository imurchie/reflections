W7D5: More Backbone Practice

Today was mostly building more with Backbone.js. This time a news reader. The actual interaction with the RSS servers was built for us, along with most of the API. The remaining work was to build out the client-side scripting to handle the feeds and entries. In practice it was a good experience, but easier than yesterday.

The other major event of the day was some discussion of final projects. I am leaning toward cloning [GoodReads](http://goodreads.com). It's not a Backbone app but much of the functionality could easily be re-envisioned to use it and be a more responsive application. Toward that end, I am thinking of incorporating [Trello](https://trello.com/)-like functions to associate and re-associate books in the user's view. It will not be too difficult and will provide some flash to the site.
