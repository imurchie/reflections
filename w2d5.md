W2D5: RSpec, `expect` and `should`

RSpec used to (and still does, though it is not the preferred approach) use fancy metaprogramming techniques in order to check expectations within tests, through the [`#should`](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/blob/master/Should.md) method:

        class Test
          def hi
            "hello!"
          end
        end

        describe Test do
          subject(:test) { Test.new }

          describe "#hi" do
            it "should return 'hello!'" do
              test.hi.should == "hello!"
            end
          end
        end

In the current version (starting with 2.11), however, `#expect` "now the recommended way to define expectations on an object" (https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/blob/master/Should.md). [Myron Marston](http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog), one of the maintainers of [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec), has an [interesting discussion of reasons for the change](http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax), primary among them problems with testing proxy objects. Since proxy objects tend to derive from the "blank slate," [`BasicObject`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/BasicObject.html), instead of [`Object`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html), the [`Kernel`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html) module is not mixed into the objects. But it is into `Kernel` that RSpec defines `#should`!

The "Blank Slate" pattern is described in Paolo Perrotta's [_Metaprogramming in Ruby_](http://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby) (p. TODO?)

        class ProxyTest < BasicObject
          def initialize(obj)
            @obj = obj
          end

          def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
            # handle dynamic routing of methods
            @obj.call(name, *args, &block)
          end
        end

When this runs in RSpec, then, the `#should` call gets caught by `ProxyTest#method_missing`, which passes it along to its delegate. But most likely the delegate object does not implement a `#should` method (and even if it does, it is even less likely to implement the RSpec `#should` method!), and so its `#method_missing` is called and we end up with a `NoMethodError`.
