W1D6-7: Disappointments

Mostly this week has been nice. Lots of programming, lots of good explanations of ways to do things. Lots of fun!

However, at one point one TA, looking over our code, took our `private` section, which was indented for clarity:

        class ClassWithPrivateMethods
          def initialize
          end

          private
            def my_private_method
            end
        end

and made them have the same indentation as the rest. Fine.

When asked why, he just said "do it." Conversation over. The conversation, however, is the only part I care about. Coding conventions are all good, but if they are unmotivated they might as well not exist.

As [James Edward Gray](http://blog.grayproductions.net) recently said on a Live ["Ruby Rogues"](http://rubyrogues.com/118-rr-live-recording-at-lonestar-ruby-conference-2013/):

> You have to have the because. It’s not, “Do this.” It’s, “Do this because.”

Without the "because," you're not teaching.



W1D6-7: Proper tools

Today I rewrote the word chain program, using a tree data structure. It is pretty amazing how things go when one uses the proper tools. Getting paths using a tree is so easy, as opposed to attempting to model a tree using `Array`s and `Hash`s. The entire implementation ended up being 75 lines long.



W1D6-7

[Tom Stuart](http://computationbook.com/) noted today that every program is just data. Take a simple program that prints out "Hello, world!":

        puts "Hello, world!"
        # => Hello, world!

This is just data to the interpretter, and can be explicitly shown as such by using `Kernel#eval`:

        program = "puts 'Hello, world!'"
        eval(progam)
        # => Hello, world!

This version can be represented (as it is in the computer) as a number:

        program_number = program.bytes.map { |byte| byte.to_s(2).rjust(8, '0') }.join.to_i(2)
        puts program_number
        # => 642026297720877653529897613128998410489325429031

Nothing is lost in this operation. The number `642026297720877653529897613128998410489325429031` is the internal representation of the `String` `puts 'Hello, world!'`
