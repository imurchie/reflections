W1D1

Today's big challenge was methodological, not technical. Having never _pair programmed_ before, there were a number of stumbling blocks. First was maintaining roles: it was difficult not to take over and do things that seemed self-evident. The obverse of this is the amount gained from pausing and then suggesting things to my partner.

The second point is related: patience.

Technically, we covered all the problems, and made some headway on a solution to the maze problem. It was definitely interesting to have to explain my choices to another person. Sometimes I had more information than him, and suggested ways that Ruby allows for us to do things. Just as often, if not moreso, he had valid objections and a perspective that added much to the work.

I'm sold on the practice, at least with a good partner. (Which, of course, begs the question of whether I am a good partner.)
