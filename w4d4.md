W4D4: Basic HTML and beyond

The funny thing about creating basic html forms and tables is that it makes the internet seem like it is 1997. After we stopped using Lynx or the command-line Mozilla, but before stylesheets gained exceptance. All we need is some animated gifs and multicolored text to induce our Geocities nightmares.

But seriously.

After generating JSON from our controllers, it feels nice to get to views and the creation of HTML. We're using Embedded Ruby (ERB) which got me thinking about the technology.

[`ERB`](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html) is part of the Ruby standard library, available to whatever programs might want to process templates:

        # template.erb
        Hello! I am just a regular file, with tags for inserting things.

        This is one: <%= name %>
        And another: <%= statement %>

The contents of the file are sent to the `ERB` class:

        # processing_erb.rb
        require "erb"

        template = File.read("template.erb")
        erb = ERB.new(template)

There are other arguments we could send in (e.g., the "safe level" at which it should be run, etc.) but we will ignore them for now. At this point the initializer sends the source to the `ERB::Compiler` whose job it is to take the string and generate Ruby code for it:

        # lib/erb.rb
        def initialize(str, safe_level=nil, trim_mode=nil, eoutvar='_erbout')
          @safe_level = safe_level
          compiler = ERB::Compiler.new(trim_mode)
          set_eoutvar(compiler, eoutvar)
          @src, @enc = *compiler.compile(str)
          @filename = nil
        end

The compiler basically reads each token from the source template, and produces `print` statements for all the non-embedded parts which are pushed into a buffer. The opening embedding tags are pushed into a stack. When it gets to a closing embedding tag it pushes the contents between the tags into the output buffer, either bare (for `<% ... %>`) or capturing and `print`ing the output (for `<%= ... %>`).

The compiler returns an array, with the template-cum-code first, then the encoding of the string passed in. So, for `template.erb` above, we get:

        # processing_erb.rb
        compiler = ERB::Compiler.new(nil)
        code, encoding = compiler.compiler(template)

        puts code
        # => print "Hello! I am just a regular file, with tags for inserting things.\nThis is one: "
        # => ; print(( name ).to_s); print "\nAnd another: "
        # => ; print(( statement ).to_s)

        puts encoding
        # => UTF-8

We can see, then, what is needed in terms of data: the two local variables. We could have embedded any sort of variable (i.e., instance, class instance, class, global) and we would have gotten those in the compiled code. Indeed, the `ERB::Compiler#compile` method _does not care_ what is in there. It does not check if it is valid Ruby when it creates the "code" string.

When we call `ERB#result` or its alias, `ERB#run`, the code compile above is executed using [`Kernel#exec`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-exec). At this point if there are invalid Ruby statements it will fail, as well as if there are unscoped variables.

The variables themselves are provided by a [`Binding`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Binding.html) (or a [`Proc`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Proc.html), though we will ignore that at the moment). So we can run the same template with different bindings, if for instance we wanted to process many different versions of the text (thinking, for instance, of an email template that we want to send to a number of users, say):

        # processing_erb.rb
        puts erb.result(binding) # use the local binding
        # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `name' for main:Object
        # => ...

        # create the local variables
        name = "Isaac"
        statement = "Yay!"

        puts erb.result(binding)
        # => Hello! I am just a regular file, with tags for inserting things.
        # =>
        # => This is one: Isaac
        # => And another: Yay!


        # get another scope
        def test_scope_binding
          name = "Usurper"
          statement = "Pwned!"
          binding
        end

        puts erb.result(test_scope_binding)
        # => Hello! I am just a regular file, with tags for inserting things.
        # =>
        # => This is one: Usurper
        # => And another: Pwned!

The real functionality comes out when we provide other bindings. Since bindings are just objects, then can be passed around, and stored (though we should be careful, since the encapsulate a local scope, and so can keep objects in memory, unavailable to be garbage collected). We can do something like

        def peanut_gallery_1
          name = "Waldorf"
          statement = "They aren’t half bad."
          binding
        end

        def peanut_gallery_2
          name = "Statler"
          statement = "Nope, they’re ALL bad!"
          binding
        end


        [peanut_gallery_1, peanut_gallery_2].each do |muppet|
          puts erb.result(muppet)
        end
        # => Hello! I am just a regular file, with tags for inserting things.
        # =>
        # => This is one: Waldorf
        # => And another: They aren’t half bad.
        # => Hello! I am just a regular file, with tags for inserting things.
        # =>
        # => This is one: Statler
        # => And another: Nope, they’re ALL bad!

Overall, then, the ERB functionality is fairly simple. Take a template, go through it to make the code that would produce that template, and then run that code in a given context. This is precisely what Rails does with its default views templating system! The context includes all the instance variables in a given controller, which are then available to the view! So:

        # app/controllers/users_controller.rb
        class UsersController < ApplicationController
          def index
            @users = User.all
            render :index
          end
        end

        # app/views/users/index.html.erb
        All users:
        <% @users.each do |user| %>
          <%= user.name %><br>
          <%= user.email %>
        <% end %>

And we get the output we want: dynamically populated pages! (And alliteration!)
