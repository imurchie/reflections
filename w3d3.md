W3D3: Associations

Today in lecture there was the useful adage with regard to [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) [associations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html)... when a table has a foreign key to another table, the Ruby object for that table has a `belongs_to` relationship to an object for the other table, and the latter object has either a `has_one` or (more commonly) a `has_many` relationship back.

This seems a very useful way to keep them straight, at least until it is second nature. It also helps clear up some of the confusion around associations through a so-called "join table," an intermediate table that stores the foreign keys of the two related objects.

So the Ruby class corresponding to the join table has two `belongs_to` relationships, one with each of the related objects, both of which have `has_many` relationships with the intermediate objects, _as well as_ `has_many :through` relationships with the other objects.

The potential for confusion is removed and all is well in the world.


W3D3: Sitting at the windows

So, today I sat at the front windows for the first time. It was hard not to watch the action.

Businessman smoking crack? Check.

Old man weilding his cane like a drum major? Check.

Other old man weilding his cane like a sword? Check.
