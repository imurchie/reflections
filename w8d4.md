W8D4: Rating Stars

The most interest problem of yesterday was handling the idea of "ratings." That is, a numeric scale applied to a text. GoodBooks displays five stars which can be chosen to set the rating, and I decided to mimic this.

Since it needs to be placed in a number of places I put the partial in its own Backbone View class, backed by a very simple JST template:

        // app/assets/templates/ratings/form.jst.ejs
        <div class="star-div">
          <% for(var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { %>
            <span class="star" id="star-<%= text.get("id") %>-<%= i %>" data-id="<%= i %>"></span>
          <% } %>
        </div>

This simply sets up a snippet of HTML with five empty spans, each uniquely identified, and carrying a payload of a rating. This is controlled by a Backbone class, which uses mouseover events to create a dynamic effect. The setting of a rating is relatively simple, just iterating over the five spans in the template, and setting an empty or full star:

        // app/assets/javascripts/views/rating_form_view.js
        setRating: function(rating) {
          for(var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            var $star = this.$el.find("#star-" + this.model.get("id") + "-" + i);
            $star.html(i > rating ? "☆" : "★")
          }
        }

This is performed either to set the base state, which is any initial rating the user has made, either when the view is rendered or when there is a `mouseout` event:

        // app/assets/javascripts/views/rating_form_view.js
        resetRating: function() {
          var rating = this.model.get("user_rating") || 0;

          this.setRating(rating);
        }

To make it dynamic, so when the user runs the mouse over the the rating bar the stars change, a `mouseover` event also triggers the resetting of the stars, this time with the potential rating:

        // app/assets/javascripts/views/rating_form_view.js
        accordionRating: function(event) {
          var rating = parseInt($(event.target).attr("data-id"));

          this.setRating(rating);
        }

In the end it was conceptually problematic but technically straightforward.
