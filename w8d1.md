W8D1: Data modeling

Having decided to clone the [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com) website for my final project, I have begun to think of the data needed for the functionality. The `User` model is relatively straightforward. Turning to the actual "data" of the site, there is some thought needed for normalization.

The most obvious component is the `Book`. We have, however gone through Structuralist/Poststructuralist revolution, and must think of things as _texts_, not _books_, no? Should the system allow one to read an essay? So `Book` should be `Text` to not tie the database to an outmoded conceptual model.

Then there is the issue of the data which should be encapsulated within `Text`. Authors of texts can have authored multiple texts, and it would be prudent to be able to handle authors separately from the books they have written. So we need to move the data of an author out of the `Text` and into an `Author`. Fruther to this relationship, texts may be written by more than one author, so we need tbe able to relate them through a join table.

Looking through GoodReads, it also seems desirable to abstract the idea of "genre" out into its own model to allow for users to interact with the books from that angle. So we need a `Genre` model, to which both the `Text` and `Author` can relate, necessitating join tables (i.e., an author may be associated with many genres, and so can texts).

The last consideration is modelling user interaction with texts/authors/genres. Two central features of the site are the ability to write self-contained reviews of texts (we'll leave it to texts for now, though there is no reason to not allow reviews of any other element of the system). So we need a `Review` model related to a user and a text. The second is a conversation about a text (again, this could be for any element. For simplicity we'll leave it to texts here). This can be modelled with a `Comment` model that can be arbitrarily nested (i.e., comments would be related to both the original text and a parent comment to which it is a reply, if it is not directly commenting on the text).

This will serve us for a basic database model:

1. `Users`
2. `Friendings` (join table for `User` -> `User` relationships)
3. `Texts`
4. `Authors`
5. `Text_authors` (join table for `Author` -> `Text` relationships)
6. `Genres`
7. `Text_genres` (join table for `Text` -> `Genre` relationships)
8. `Author_genres` (join table for `Author` -> `Genre` relationships)
9. `Reviews`
10. `Comments`

The full site has many other objects which are related to authors and texts: quotes, stories, lists, trivia, etc. Some of these might be added as time is available, but are unrelated to the central functionality of the site.
